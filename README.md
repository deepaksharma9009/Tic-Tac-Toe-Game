# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game often played on a 3x3 grid. The game is played by two players who take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in empty squares within the grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their chosen symbol.
